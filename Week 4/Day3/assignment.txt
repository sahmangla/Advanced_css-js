1.What is Pipe Transform in Angular?  Why do we use it?
An interface that is implemented by pipes in order to perform a transformation. Angular invokes the transform method with the value of a binding as the 
first argument, and any parameters as the second argument in list form.
Eg.
interface PipeTransform 
{transform(value: any, ...args: any[]): any}


2.How to use slice pipe in Angular?
SlicePipe is used to create an array containing a slice of the element.
Syntax:
{{ value | SlicePipe }}
Example:
TS FILE:
export class AppComponent {
    collection: string[] = ['geeks', 'for', 'geeks', 'gfg'];
  }
app.component.html FILE:
<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let i of collection | slice:0:3">{{i}}</li>
</ul>
