1. What are the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript ?  Find some more details about pop-boxes?
Alert Box:-
This popup or dialog box is used to display an alert or warning message to the user. To proceed, the user must click “OK.” We 
use the alert() method of the window object to show an alert dialog box in JavaScript.

Confirm Box:-
It is a popup box used to get permission or confirmation from the user. There are two buttons in the confirm box: “OK” and 
“Cancel”. To continue, the user must select either “OK” or “Cancel”. It returns true if the user clicks on the “OK” button, 
otherwise, then false is returned.
In JavaScript, we use the window’s object confirm() method to take consent from the user.

Prompt Box:-
It is a dialog or popup box which is used to get some input from the user before allowing them to move on to the next step. 
This popup box has an input field, “OK” and “Cancel” buttons.
We use the prompt() method of the window object in JavaScript to take input from the user. The prompt() method takes two 
parameters: the message you want to display and the default value. The value returned by prompt() is stored in a variable 
and used to execute some action.
