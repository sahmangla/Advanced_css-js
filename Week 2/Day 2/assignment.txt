1. What is setInterval()  and setTimeout() methods in JavaScript?
setTimeout():-
---------------
JavaScript setTimeout() calls a method after a certain period of milliseconds have passed. The method is only called once. 
The setTimeout() method lets you introduce delays into your code.

Letâ€™s take a look at the syntax for this method:
window.setTimeout(function, time);

The two parameters accepted by setTimeout are:

function : The function you want to execute after a period of time has passed.
time : The amount of time your program should wait before executing a function.

setInterval():-
---------------

The JavaScript setInterval() method calls a function repeatedly. A specified delay is set between each time a function is called.

setInterval() uses a similar syntax to setTimeout():
window.setInterval(function, time);

You must specify two parameters to use setInterval:

function: The function that will be executed.
time: The time between each call of the function you have specified.


2. What is Asynchronous?
The async attribute is a boolean attribute.

If the async attribute is set, the script is downloaded in parallel to parsing the page, and executed as soon as it is 
available. The parsing of the page is interrupted once the script is downloaded completely, and then the script is executed, 
before the parsing of the rest of the page continues.

Note: The async attribute is only for external scripts (and should only be used if the src attribute is present).
