1. How to add events to html elements at runtime using javascript?
JavaScript allows you to attach event listeners to HTML elements so that you can run a certain function when an event is 
triggered. Some examples of events are when a button is “clicked” or when the mouse pointer is moved to touch the element.

The built-in method addEventListener() allows you to attach an event listener to an HTML element. It accepts two parameters:
the event type to listen to and the callback function to run when the event is triggered:
		Element.addEventListener(type, callbackFn);


2. How to use keypress, keyup, keydown events? 
a)When user presses a key or combination of different keys, keydown, keypress and keyup are triggered in that order:
-->keydown: This event is triggered first when user presses a key.
-->keyup: This event is triggered last when user releases a key.
-->keypress: This event is triggered when a key is pressed. This event fails to recognise keys such as tab, shift, ctrl, 
backspace etc. onKeyDown, onKeyPress, and onKeyUp events can be used to detect these events respectively.

b)The keydown and keyup events are often used to handle the physical keys, while the keypress event is used to handle 
characters which are being typed. The keypress ignores keys such as delete, arrows, page up, page down, home, end, ctrl, alt, 
shift, esc, etc. So, if we need to handle those keys, it's better to use either keydown or keyup event.

c)The keydown and keypress events fire multiple times if user press and hold a key.While keyup fires only once when user 
releases the key.
