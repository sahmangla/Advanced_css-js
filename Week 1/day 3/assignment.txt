1. What is BOM? Difference between DOM and BOM?
The BOM (Browser Object Model) consists of the objects navigator, history, screen, location and document which are children 
of window. In the document node is the DOM (Document Object Model), the document object model, which represents the contents 
of the page. You can manipulate it using javascript.
Document Object Model:-
---------------------
The DOM is the Document Object Model, which deals with the document, the HTML elements themselves, e.g. document and all 
traversal you would do in it, events, etc.
Browser Object Model:-
---------------------
The BOM is the Browser Object Model, which deals with browser components aside from the document, like history, location, 
navigator and screen (as well as some others that vary by browser).


2. What is event target property in javascript?
The event.target property helps find the name of the HTML element used to trigger the event. For example, if we call a 
function from an HTML element click event, we can determine the specified element name to trigger and call a function.To get 
that property, we call event.target and store it in a variable like let variable = event.target. Now, we can get multiple 
event.target properties with that variable. It returns a reference to the object on which the event occurred. With the help 
of the target property of the event, we can do the following tasks.
a)We can get the element that triggers the event.
b)We can get access to the element properties.
c)We can easily modify some properties of the element.\
