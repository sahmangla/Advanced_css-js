1.What is axois package - npm?  Why do we use it in React?
-->Axios is used to communicate with the backend and it also supports the Promise API that is native to JS ES6.  
-->It is a library which is used to make requests to an API, return data from the API, and then do things with that data in our React application. 
-->Axios is a very popular HTTP client, which allows us to make HTTP  requests from the browser. 

Axios allows us to communicate with APIs easily in our React apps. Though this can also be achieved by other methods like fetch or AJAX, Axios can provide a little more functionality that goes a long way with applications that use React.  
Axios is a promise-based library used with Node.js and our browser to make asynchronous JavaScript HTTP requests.
